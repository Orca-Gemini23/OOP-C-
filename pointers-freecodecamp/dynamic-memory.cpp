// application memory is divided as:
// heap, stack, global/static and code (text)

 
// if the call stack is filled up due to calling function
// then the stack will overflow .

// ex : back recursion

/*
heap is called dynamic memory and is the free storage
also heap is a data-structure but is completely different
and stack is also a ds but is related.


for c : malloc, calloc, realloc, free
for c++: new, delete
