// list : stores a given number of elements , like arrays , but.
/* But i need list which we has empty list of size 
insert , remove, count, read/modify and also specify the data type 

Access - Read/write element at an index :: constant time O(1)
Insert - Shift element towards the right :: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array
remove :: O(n)
Add :: O(n) 

using array is not an efficient technique though due to memory issues.
