// Access the element
In arrays the cost of accesing an element is in constant time 
but in linked list is O(n);

// Memory req:
array is of fixed size and memory may not be available as one large block.
in linked list there is no unused memory and there is no reserved memory 
but we have extra memory for pointers. Also memory may be available as multiple 
small blocks.

// Cost of insertion
array: 1. at beginning :: O(n)
     : 2. at end :: O(1) // if array is not full 
     :    at end :: O(n) // if array is full 
     : 3. at i position: O(n)
linked list: 1. O(n)
             2. O(n)
             3. O(n)
