why pointers ?

the memory is divided into 3 categories :
1 heap 
2. stack
3. code section 

the main funct gets into code section and it can access 
the stack part too. 

the program cant directly access the heap 
so the program can have a pointer which is in the stack and that can
point to the heap.

file pointers  are used for the file pointers 
network and wireless can be accessed indirectly with the help of 
pointers. 

no system programming through c# or java.
