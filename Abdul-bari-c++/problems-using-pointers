Problems:
1. Unintialized pointers
2. Memory leak
3. Dangling pointers

1.)) int *p;
*p = 25;
Here the pointer is not pointing to anything but garbage value 
the pointer should be locating to a location.

solution (1): 1. initialize it to a var
2. p = (int*)0x5632 :: we can initialize to a address resembling 
our program
3. p = new int[5];

2.)) When allocating memory on leak and when we dont 
need it we should deallocate or we will run out of memory

sol : Method for the deallocation
 delete []p;
p = NULL;
p = 0;
p = nullptr; 

3.)) When a pointer is being accessed but the pointer
is deallocated by either a different function 
(the pointer was initialize but was deallocated).
