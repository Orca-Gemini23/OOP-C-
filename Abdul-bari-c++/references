References:

in a main function we have a variable  x and some memory is allocated
to it.

int x = 10;
int &y = x;
// this x here is the l-value. 
// this is a reference . it is an alias of x ;; nickname of x;
it has the same address. 
// references doesnt require any memory.

// reference can only be used once.

 both x and y are accessing the same address 
 a change to x and change to y will change the value in it;

 int a;
 a = x; // here r-value is the right hand side value 
 // data of x;
 or 
 x = 25; // here x is the left hand value 
 // address of x;

and 25 is the value in the location of both x and y;
